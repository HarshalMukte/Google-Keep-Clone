Hello Family,

I had created a "Google Keep"  clone using react.

I am here to display my work and get the best suggestions.

Technologies used: React 
For storing the data(notes) locally in the user's computer, I have used local storage.

For live view: https://harshal-google-keep.netlify.app/

Please have a look to the following features and functions

1.	A user can input his notes through input section on the top.
 
2.	A user has the control to delete, update and archive his note
     
 

3.	A user can search the words in the notes using the search bar input
 

4.	A user can also change the colour of notes based on their likes.
 

5.	User can change the style of the notes(i.e.  List style or Grid Style )
 

6.	Archive notes present in the archive section, user can unarchive notes according their needs.
 

7.	Deleted notes are available in the trash section, user can restore them back when they needed
 
8.	It also has a dark mode for the better User Experience
 

Thank  you.
